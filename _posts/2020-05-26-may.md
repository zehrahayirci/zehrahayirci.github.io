description: How to keep alive when you are writing your thesis

I have passed my masterâ€™s thesis!
It was not easy to focus on corona times in Japan and Germany. 
I had though&good times, but such a relief in the end! I just want to share some tips to people who are struggling like me.

1. Your thesis will end. Remember this when you are lost, desperate, questioning your life at 3AM. In the end, you have created something, accomplished and done. It is a satisfaction you can find nowhere else.

2. We have a tendency to underestimate the time to complete tasks. Prepare yourself for this. It is normal that you will fall into this trap too. When this happens,do not 
go hard on yourself. [Know your limits!](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/Royetal2005PsychBull.pdf)

3. Use a [reference management system](https://www.mendeley.com/), for each paper you read, try to summarize the idea, what they achieve, what is missing, how you can contribute to the area. 

4. Plan your evaluation metrics upfront. Look at datasets, other works use, to know what you need to do. If you have your own and compare it with others, send them your dataset way before the deadline. 

5. There may be a point where you stuck with writing, especially the method. Sometimes you don't have a clear idea of what you did even though you just did it. It takes more understanding to explain clearly what you did than it took to do it. 

6. Try creating online study groups. We have an online room with my friends who are working home-office, prepping for GMAT, writing applications. I am so blessed we have this online library. 
We use [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) because you can give your room a name and share it with anyone. It is opensource. Also we use our own customized [pomodore timer](https://www.marinaratimer.com/). Everybody can join simultaneously. 

7. Things helped me: pomodoro method, writing todo lists, using [headspace app](https://www.headspace.com/), talking with people, having small rituals for coffee and writing journals.
