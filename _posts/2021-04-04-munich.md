Finally, it is the spring time! I was a bit jealous scrolling instagram posts of my frineds in Tokyo. Sakura season and all the pink blossloms reminds me of the best springs that I have ever had in there. Thankfully, I spot some trees in Munich as well! They are not much as in Japan but still works for quick "I wish I was in Tokyo now" attacks. Here is the list for some of them:

1. Georgenstraße 10


2. Kaulbachstraße 47


3. Leopoldstraße 6


4. Leopoldstraße 20


5. Intersection of Leopoldstraße and Schackstraße


6. Clemensstraße 56


7. Bayernpark


8. Hiltenspergerstraße


9. Böttingerstraße


10. Schwere-Reiter-Straße 28


11. Olympiapark Martin-Luther-King-Weg,Lovelockweg,Werner-Seelenbinder-Weg
