I started this new year with a tour around Japan. I visited Kyoto, Nagoya,Kanazawa,Osaka, Nagano and went back Tokyo. If you want to see some photos of Japan, [here is my photo diary](https://www.instagram.com/tokyoda100gun/).

In Tokyo, everyday I feel like I am playing a game of discoveries. Lunch between office hours must be a quick, but  fulfilling one. Tokyo solves this with introducing [Lunch Passport](https://lunchpassport.com/), which gives you a fixed menu,mostly Japanese Taishoku, with discounted prices in your office area. I enjoy each day trying different set menus while discovering the neighbourhood more closely. I wish we had the same everywhere! About culture, I joined a traditional Japanese dance workshop, learned the dance [Sakura Sakura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqpFjsMtCb0) is one of the famous traditional songs. ( I find it too slow as well )

I am still in a love/hate relationship with [Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662.Atlas_Shrugged). More willing to talk about it when I decide what to think about it. The movie of the month is [Kiki’s Delivery Service](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097814/). Since I watched it after visiting the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo, I am even more amazed. In the museum, you can see how they put together all the research and hard work together to tell a wonderful heartwarming story.  Read this [open love letter to Miyazaki](https://entropymag.org/brooms-moving-and-growing-up-an-essaylove-letter-to-hayao-miyazakis-kikis-delivery-service/), after you watch the movie.

I had just realized that creators of The High Line NY and The Broad museum LA are the same. Their new work The Shed opening in April. If you want some eye-candy [here is their portfolio](https://dsrny.com/). 

The music I listen to this month

The coldest weather and chocolate season comes to Tokyo in February. Let’s see how it will end up.
