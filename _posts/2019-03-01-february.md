I work more on visual projects because it is such a relief  to see something after pressing the button. That is why I am pursuing to be a computer vision researcher.  However, world is beyond what is happening before our eyes. We have amazing ideas and vivid feelings that we can never be seen. When it comes to express these, we communicate in language. Another wonderful thing that we cannot see, but we practice in every way. I have made my first interaction with Neural Language Processing this month with [MLT's first paper reading group](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/paper_readings/blob/master/NLP/1_a_unified_architecture/README.md) on paper [A Unified Architecture for Natural Language Processing:
Deep Neural Networks with Multitask Learning](https://ronan.collobert.com/pub/matos/2008_nlp_icml.pdf) Though the paper is quite old for now, some of the concepts presented ten years ago are still = valuable today. It is not a surprise that it is selected as test-of-time award in the 2018 International Conference of Machine Learning. While we have a delightful and informative brainstorming, we think about the future of language processing. Again, we are not at [there](https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/technologies/2019/?linkId=64136332) **yet**, but closing the gap every day.

Nowadays, we can have a conversation with Alexa on daily basis. If we remember what it was like to do the same 20 years ago, [Cleverbot](https://www.cleverbot.com/) is still there for some nostalgia. How AI can understand what we mean? The first thing they do, they split the sentence into meaningful parts then gather these together according to their relationships. AI is not alone, we can define grammar rules and semantic roles in a sentence. For instance; 

> I want to go to the cinema this evening.

The first thing AI looks is the verb, _go_. We can define that go has a target in the sentence. Then it finds _the cinema_ 
Then _last Saturday_ is a time adverb. Just like we did in elementary school, AI searcher for semantic roles of the chunks and combines them. Later, it can suggest nearest theatres or movie times. 

Another point is, the paper was trained on all [Wikipedia dataset](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/). Is a formal written dataset enough for deducing whole language?  I don’t believe so. There is so much stuff that we talk but is never written, also our tone and pauses in between words or the filler words tell the story together. At the same time, these creates ambiguities which leads undesirable communication issues everyday. The first man who fed up with this misunderstanding was Ludwig Wittgenstein. He realized that when we talk, we refer to images of words in our mind. Just like in the above sentence 
_"I want to go to the cinema this evening."_ You might as well think about Godzilla at Shinjuku TOHO cinemas. Maybe you have pictured your casual Friday movie theatre. See, how different our images are!

When we do not share the same picture with our company, we easily fall into misunderstanding. There is another danger of assuming something that is not in the sentence in the first place. Because we have abstract words, subjective adjectives and many other background memories we refer to when we tell the story that diverges from our company’s, if you want to dig more on his first work [Tractatus](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5740/5740-pdf.pdf) is about how impossible to communicate with another in languages because we don't have certain rules. I also recommend [Logicomix](https://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521) who is lost in Wittgenstein's abstract expressions. It is the story of the great logician Bertrand Russell. Through his life, you can find traces of some other famous philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Gödel. It gives you a lot of ideas and could be an enjoyable start to logic philosophy. 

Before coming to Tokyo, I did not know that the Japanese prefer not to say things in a direct manner and always look for a roundabout way in communication. The main reason for that is to being polite, putting no force on demands and living in harmony. Japanese always find a way to reject you before you even realized that you are being rejected. Since they are accustomed to communicating in this way, even they speak English or another language, you can observe that they still try their best to use indirect expressions. I think I agree more and more Wittgenstein after spending some time in Japan. When we try to make AI understand our language, we also understand better how complicated the communication is and how we manage to survive with it. 

If you find it an interesting game to deduce cultural tips in the shadow of the language [Understanding Cultures Through Their Key Words](http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_0195088360.pdf) shows you examples of culture and language while comparing German, Japanese, Russian English and Polish. I just gave a basic example in Japanese, but you can guess many. Well, another one for German: they usually put the time adverb in the beginning of a sentence, which is a reflection of their punctuality. (Not you, Deutsche Bahn!)

I finally put an end to [Atlas Shrugged](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662.Atlas_Shrugged). I feel full of railways, copper and any kind of money talk. [Ayn Rand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8m8cQI4DgM) is someone that you cannot stay objective. You must hate or love her ideas. I try my best not to hate the cruel idea of money and materialism. I even sometimes think that she might have some points right, but in the end, I am more on the hate side. If you think differently or want to share my hatred, I can offer you a cup of coffee, or a couple of [emails!](mailto:zehra@gmail.com)
